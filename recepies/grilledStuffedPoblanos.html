    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 poblano peppers</li>
      <li>5 ears corn, husks and silks removed</li>
      <li>1 (15-ounce can) no-salt-added black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling, lighting burners on just
        one side or pushing lit coals to one side. Preheat to medium-high heat
        (375 to 400 degrees F (180 to 200 degrees C)). Lightly oil grill grates
        over lit side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grill poblanos and corn, covered, turning occasionally, until poblano
        skins and corn are charred, about 10 minutes. Keep grill lit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer poblanos to a large bowl, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes.
        Meanwhile, let corn stand until cool enough to handle; cut kernels from
        cobs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove and discard poblano skins, keeping stems intact. Make a
        lengthwise slit down one side of each poblano, starting at stem and
        being careful not to cut through to other side. Remove and discard seeds
        and membranes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together beans, corn kernels, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt,
        cumin, and black pepper in a large bowl. Spoon about 1/2 cup bean
        mixture into each pepper, enclosing pepper around the filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the cheese sauce, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low
        heat; whisk in flour. Cook, stirring until lightly browned, 1 to 2
        minutes. Whisk in milk; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2 to
        3 minutes. Gradually whisk in cheese until melted. Remove from heat and
        keep warm, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly oil grill grate over unlit side of grill. Grill stuffed
        poblanos, covered, until filling is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve immediately with cheese sauce; pico de gallo; and (if using)
        cilantro, lime wedges, and/or radishes. Garnish with chili powder.
      </li>
    </ol>
